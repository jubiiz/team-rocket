  done: 
    + all Arduinos work
    + all githubs work
    + pressure sensor appears functional. Basic calibration achieved
    + data file created; basic engine specs logged (dimensions)
    + environment sensor appears functional, credible readings
    + brainstorm & first model of dry-fire engine socket
    
26 jan:
  todo:
    + plastic engine holder printed
    + engine holder functional and stable (and SAFE)
    + dry-fire engine to confirm thrust (should be ish 29N)
    
    + patched pressure sensor code (for multiple sensors at once)
    + recalibrate pressure sensor for up to 29N
    + figure out how to run arduino stuff from sd
    + our own version of environmental sensor code (for altitude)
