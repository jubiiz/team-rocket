19 jan:
  todo: ?
  done: 
    + all Arduinos work
    + all githubs work
    + pressure sensor appears functional. Basic calibration achieved
    + data file created; basic engine specs logged (dimensions)
    + environment sensor appears functional, credible readings
    + brainstorm & first model of dry-fire engine socket
    
26 jan:
  done: 
    + patched pressure sensor code (for multiple sensors at once)
    + manufactured little pads for the pressure sensors (gives consistent readings)
    + our own version of environmental sensor code (for altitude)
    + computerless data logging


  todo:
    + triple pressure sensor settup built (where they each individually can measure pressure)
    + engine holder functional and stable (and SAFE)
    + dry-fire engine to confirm thrust (should be ish 29N)
    + test chute code: appropriate deployment + log

    + recalibrate pressure sensor for up to 29N
    + figure out how to run arduino stuff from sd
    + finalized, clean pressure sensor code
    + loggable chute code (to verify deployment)

19 feb:
    + chute deploy: check accelerometer (less than normal G everywhere?)
    + legit deployChute() system (not just blinking led)
    + figure out servo
    + 


17 mars:
    + spi works?
    + i2c works?
    + i2c and spi works?
    + can I use other pwm pins to power stuff??
    + env sensor on 3.3 volts on i2c?
    : works on small arduino with everything :))

21 mars, todo for 22, launch on 23
verifications:
	X arduino works
		blink with computer
	O Solders and sensors work
		X 9v psu
			X blink on psu
		X get env data from sd
		X get mpu data from sd
		X get sd to log files ok
		O get chute code to deploy on pressure increase (bmeTest)
		O ccs811 data obtainable
		X servo spins desired amount with ok force
	X test servo activation
		repeatedly run code that sets it at x degrees, see if it comes back, maybe manual set for final
	x timer code works
		X pre-register timer average duration calculated
			negligible
		X pre-register timer works
		x add timer log to sd in final_lite (0, 1)
		x max time timer works
		x logs at ish correct intervals
		x are able to time "launch" with Â±1 second (important for safeguard timer not to early deploy)
