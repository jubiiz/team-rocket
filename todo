  todo: ?
  done: 
    + all Arduinos work
    + all githubs work
    + pressure sensor appears functional. Basic calibration achieved
    + data file created; basic engine specs logged (dimensions)
    + environment sensor appears functional, credible readings
    + brainstorm & first model of dry-fire engine socket
    
26 jan:
  done: 
    + patched pressure sensor code (for multiple sensors at once)
    + manufactured little pads for the pressure sensors (gives consistent readings)
    + our own version of environmental sensor code (for altitude)
    + computerless data logging


  todo:
    + triple pressure sensor settup built (where they each individually can measure pressure)
    + engine holder functional and stable (and SAFE)
    + dry-fire engine to confirm thrust (should be ish 29N)
    + test chute code: appropriate deployment + log

    + recalibrate pressure sensor for up to 29N
    + figure out how to run arduino stuff from sd
    + finalized, clean pressure sensor code
    + loggable chute code (to verify deployment)

19 feb:
    + chute deploy: check accelerometer (less than normal G everywhere?)
    + legit deployChute() system (not just blinking led)
    + figure out servo
    +
