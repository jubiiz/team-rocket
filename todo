  todo: ?
  done: 
    + all Arduinos work
    + all githubs work
    + pressure sensor appears functional. Basic calibration achieved
    + data file created; basic engine specs logged (dimensions)
    + environment sensor appears functional, credible readings
    + brainstorm & first model of dry-fire engine socket
    
26 jan:
  todo:
    + plastic engine holder printed
    + triple pressure sensor settup built (where they each individually can measure pressure)
    + engine holder functional and stable (and SAFE)
    + dry-fire engine to confirm thrust (should be ish 29N)
    
    + td patched pressure sensor code (for multiple sensors at once) 
    + recalibrate pressure sensor for up to 29N
    + our own version of environmental sensor code (for altitude)
    + discussion on flowchart of environmental sensor program for chute deployment (regarding data safeguard or extensive logging)
    + computerless data logging
    + altitude detection irl tests: anomaly detection
