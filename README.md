## Our team's programs made and used in the context of our Rocket Science class

In the scope of our _Case studies in Applied Sciences_ class (colloquially known as Rocket Science with our peers and teachers), we were tasked with building a rocket that would fly 9 weeks later. If possible, the rocket would carry an Arduino that would record data and deploy a parachute. 

We have successfully built a rocket, onboard which was an ABRA Nano connected to 2 sensors (BME280 and MPU650), 1 servo motor that would deploy a parachute, and 1 MicroSD card adapter. The rocket was launched on March 23rd. The parachute successfully opened at rocket apogee, but the rope failed, the parachute detached, the rocket nose-dove into a nearby thicket, and is still there. We searched for it for hours, unsuccessfully. A second search expedition is planned to take place in the next few weeks (in April). 

>>>>> The code that rode aboard the rocket was "final_lite0.ino" in the folder "final/final_lite0"
